## Stat 114 Final Project Vignette - GPT Integration for Biomedical PDF Summaries

The objective of this project is to automatically summarize sections of biomedical research papers as dictated by user highlights. Within this tutorial, you can use our tools to automatically create a Beamer slideshow that summarizes sections of Love et al's DESeq2 paper:

1. Clone this repo with
```sh
git clone git@github.com:MattKotzbauer/pdf-reader-vignette.git 
```
2. Mark down `love.pdf` by highlighting the starting and ending sentences of sections you would like summarized. For each pair of highlights, our program will end up summarizing the text between them. Any software should work for annotating the document, a few examples being
- Adobe Acrobat
- Microsoft Edge
- Preview
- Okular

3. call scripts to generate prompts

```sh
```
